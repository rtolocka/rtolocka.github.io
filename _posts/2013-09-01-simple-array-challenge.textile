You're writing a front-end component that interfaces with several content management systems. Your system ingests content from a few spots and outputs it to the web in a slightly different format. Can you do this exercise without cheating (cough) Googling?

The biggest challenge you're currently facing surrounds tagging of content, and the proper output of that content to the browser. Each piece of content has been tagged by multiple systems and their tagging has been way too extensive and inconsistent for display on the front end as-is. Your job is to take each piece of content, reconcile the tags across the source systems, and display the appropriate amount of content to the end user.

As part of this challenge, you'll be presented three arrays each from each of the three source systems:

<pre><code>
tags = ['blah', 'bored', 'yet?', 'wow']
moreTags = ['mexicali', 'snoopy', 'stewart', nil, nil, 'eyeball']
yepMoreTags = ['neon', 'tora', ['bora', '', 'bizarre'], 'barbecue', 'gdjasljdlk']
</pre></code>

You'll note that for bizarre reasons unknown to most of your peers, the third tag set being generated by a legacy Cobol system is inserting arrays within arrays; apparently this cannot be fixed without hauling a bunch of mothballed developers out of retirement, so you've decided to make do with what you've got.

Exercise 1: Merge these arrays into a single array and output the combined result to the console (for the purposes of this quiz, we'll pretend that the console is equivalent to the website.) 

Exercise 2: Good job! Now let's remove the duplicates, as well as the nil and empty values, and handle the (ahem) Cobol issue.

Exercise 3: You'll note that the contents of the new array has inconsistent capitalization. Change all of the elements of the array to have title case, i.e. "Snoopy" instead of "snoopy".

Exercise 4: Resort the contents of your single array to be alphabetical. 

Exercise 5: After seeing the results, the business customer has realized that they don't want to show the entirety of the tag list to users if there are more than 6 in the list. Instead, they only wish to show the first 3 and the last 3. Write code that outputs the first 3 of the array, followed by an ellipsis, then the last three of the array. Only do this if there are more than 6 items.

Exercise 6: After seeing this set of results, the business is worried the user will be confused or unsure about how many tags there are. Add a tag count at the end of the list of tags in brackets.
