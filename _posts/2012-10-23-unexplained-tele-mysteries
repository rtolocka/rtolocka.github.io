Every three months or so, I forget how the switching system on my CIJ Jerry Donahue Telecaster works. So, mostly for my age-addled brain, here it is. This is sourced from an excellent post on CIJ/MIJ Fender guitars:

<pre>“Here is how the STOCK switching works: Position 1) The Bridge PU give Jerry’s favorite customized 1952 vintage sound.Position 2) The Bridge PU and the Neck PU out-of-phase. This gives that unique Strat sound, as it puts a Tele PU and the Vintage Strat PU in an out-of-phase mode. Really cool JD trick. Position 3) The Bridge PU and the Neck PU in parallel, like a stock Tele in the middle switch position, creating a sweet full rhythm sound. Position 4) The Neck pickup going through the tone control. Position 5) The Neck PU by-passing the tone control.”</pre>
