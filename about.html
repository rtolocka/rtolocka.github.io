<h4>The skills</h4>
<p>
<ul>
	<li><strong>Java</strong> - I started developing in Java sometime around 2000; I spent a lot of my twenties developing enterprise Java applications using Swing (with a bit of web stuff thrown in too - back when web sites were what you did when you grew tired of beating your head against tougher problems.) At one point, I was a Java Certified Programmer and for fun I grabbed a few other Java certifications as well.
	<li><strong>Ruby</strong> - I’ve been developing in Ruby since 2011, and it’s currently my “go-to” language for pretty much, well, anything. I enjoy being astonished at its economy and grace.</li>
	<li><strong>Rails</strong> - I’m not a Rails “hotshot” (yet) but I’ve developed a few applications in Rails, enjoy working with it as a framework, and continue to focus on growing in this area. Given my (occasionally painful) time spent developing enterprise applications using J2EE, Rails is a breath of fresh air.</li>
	<li><strong>HTML & CSS</strong> - I can write CSS and troubleshoot others’ CSS and HTML. I can troubleshoot positioning, manage floats, implement sprites, and know why you do a CSS reset. I’m capable of implementing intermediate-level HTML and CSS layouts from PSDs. I have experience with both Bootstrap and Foundation (in case that matters to you) and have started to utilize Sass over the last year.
	</li>	
	<li><strong>Other</strong> - 
    <ul>
      <li>I run Linux (Mint, specifically) for my own development projects and pride myself on knowing my way around the shell.</li>
      <li>I know Git and I'm comfortable with advanced configuration management workflows.</li>
      <li>I have considerable experience with complex database schemas, and I’m able to develop complex queries, analyze problematic SQL, and optimize.</li>
      <li>I’ve done a good bit of JQuery - I'm not a whiz but I can make good use of it when needed. 
      <li>I’m a "certified" Scrummaster as well as a proudly expired PMP. I know and have practiced Agile, and can troubleshoot process issues and lead a technical team.</li>
      <li>Finally, I have a good deal of expertise in Drupal and the overall process involved in building high-traffic, high-profile websites - but I am not a Drupal or PHP developer.</li>
    </ul>
</ul>

<h4>The story</h4>
<p>
I’ve been doing “programming” since I was in my teens, but I’ll spare you those boring stories.
</p><p>
During college, I majored in business, took a bunch of computer science classes, and hung around the computer lab a bit too much. During one summer, I interned in the Information Systems group for Nycomed Pharmaceuticals. This was my first practical exposure to business systems and I remain grateful for the opportunity.
</p><p>
After graduating from the College of William and Mary, I spent 8 years working at <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Management_Systems" target="_blank">American Management Systems</a> (which became CACI following the dissolution of the former) in a variety of capacities - acting as everything from a technical writer to analyst to build/configuration manager to lead developer. Eventually I became something like a combination project manager and technical lead. There we re-built Powerbuilder applications and other legacy systems using J2EE. Application servers like WebLogic and JBoss (huzzah!!) crawled out of the evolutionary mud, crashed frequently, and sometimes we cried and/or drank beer. We experienced <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fallacies_of_Distributed_Computing" target="_blank">this</a> first hand; caches were built and refined; we read “Design Patterns” and refactored; a good time was had by most.
</p><p>
In 2006 I joined Phase2 Technology. Similar to AMS, I’ve done many things along the way - testing, business analysis, client management, and development - and hopefully I’ve done them well. Along the way I’ve continued to learn technically - can I ask for anything more?
