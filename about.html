<h4>The skills</h4>
<p>
<ul>
	<li>Java - I started developing in Java sometime around 2000; I spent a lot of my twenties developing enterprise Java applications using Swing (with a bit of web stuff thrown in too back when web sites were cute things you did when you were tired of beating your head against tougher problems.) At one point, I was a Java Certified Programmer and achieved few other Java-related certifications as well - mostly for fun and not profit.</li>
	<li>Ruby - I’ve been developing in Ruby since 2011, and it’s currently my “go-to” language for pretty much, well, anything. Considering it was built on the 'principals of least astonishment', I enjoy being astonished at its economy and grace. I blog on the language periodically, and I credit it with renewing my interest in development. I tend to use Jekyll for developing smallish sites.</li>
	<li>Rails - I’m not a Rails “hotshot” (yet) but I’ve developed a few applications in Rails, enjoy working with it as a framework, and continue to focus on growing in this area. Given my (occasionally painful) time spent developing enterprise applications using J2EE, Rails is a breath of fresh air.</li>
	<li>HTML & CSS - I can write CSS and troubleshoot others’ CSS and HTML. I can troubleshoot positioning, manage floats, implement sprites, and know why you do a CSS reset. I’m capable of implementing intermediate-level HTML and CSS layouts from PSDs. I have experience with both Bootstrap and Foundation (in case that matters to you) and have started to utilize SASS over the last year.
	</li>	
	<li>Other - I run Linux (Mint, specifically) for my own development projects and pride myself on knowing my way around the shell. I can find my way around a relational database, and I’m able to analyze problematic SQL and optimize queries. I’ve done a good bit of JQuery; I'm not a whiz but I can certainly employ it to good use. I’m a certified Scrummaster as well as an expired PMP, I know and have practiced Agile, and can troubleshoot process issues and lead a technical team. Finally, I have a good deal of expertise in Drupal and the overall process involved in building high-traffic, high-profile websites - but I am not a Drupal or PHP developer.</li>
</ul>

<h4>The story</h4>
</p>
I’ve been doing “programming” since I was in my teens, but I’ll spare you those boring stories.

During college, I interned in the Information Systems group for Nycomed Pharmaceuticals. This was my first practical exposure to business systems and I remain grateful for the opportunity.

After graduating from the College of William and Mary, I spent 8 years working at AMS (which became CACI following the dissolution of the former) in a variety of capacities - everything from technical writer to analyst to lead developer, eventually becoming something like a combination project manager and technical lead. There we re-built Powerbuilder applications and other legacy systems using J2EE. Application servers like WebLogic and JBoss (huzzah!!) crawled out of the evolutionary mud, crashed frequently, and we cried. We experienced <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fallacies_of_Distributed_Computing" target="_blank">this</a> first hand; caches were built and refined; we read “Design Patterns” and refactored; a good time was had by all.

In 2006 I joined Phase2 Technology. Similar to AMS, I’ve done many things along the way - testing, business analysis, client management, and development - and hopefully I’ve done them well. Along the way I’ve continued to learn technically - can I ask for anything more?
