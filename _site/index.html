		<h3>Mastering your Ruby Environment</h3>
		<p>05 July 2013</p>
		<p>rbenvruby </p>
		<p><p>
<p>Recently I had an issue where a Gem wouldn&#8217;t install properly. As it turned out, I was using the wrong <em>type</em> of ruby (more specifically I was using plain ruby instead of ruby-dev, which is a whole other blog post for another day). This ended up being a great opportunity for a blog post on &#8216;mastering your ruby environment.&#8217; Like many of my posts, this one is oriented towards basic knowledge that beginners can use.</p></p>
<h3>What version of Ruby are you running?</h3>
<p>To determine which version of Ruby is being invoked from the shell, this is relatively straight-forward:</p>
<pre>ruby --version</pre>
<p>This will tell you which version of Ruby you&#8217;re running, but it&#8217;s often helpful to know where this version of Ruby is installed. For this, run the Linux command:<br />
<code>which ruby</code><br />
Depending on what the output is, you&#8217;ll either be shocked or quite bored. Either way, take a look at your $<span class="caps">PATH</span> variable to confirm your suspicions about how your particular version of Ruby is being loaded:<br />
<pre>echo $<span class="caps">PATH</span></pre><br />
<h3>Switching it up</h3><br />
Should you find yourself wanting to change your Ruby version, it&#8217;s important to proceed with caution. Ruby comes installed on your system because it&#8217;s likely to be used by system programs &#8211; therefore, it&#8217;s not a good idea to be removing it or upgrading it in place. Instead, there are a variety of tools used to allow you to switch between various versions of Ruby as needed for development purposes.</p>
<p>The first of these tools is <span class="caps">RVM</span>. Short for Ruby Version Manager, <span class="caps">RVM</span> does &#8216;a lot&#8217; in one package. The second of these tools is rbenv. Rbenv is more modular, using plug-ins to do things like <a href="https://github.com/sstephenson/ruby-build">install particular versions of Ruby</a>Â or <a href="http://www.bundler.io">manage gem sets</a>. My personal preference is for rbenv, but that&#8217;s probably because, as a Java developer, I&#8217;m more comfortable with the manner in which rbenv works &#8211; by manipulating your <span class="caps">PATH</span>.</p>
<p>Installing rbenv is pretty straight ahead; I&#8217;d highly recommend you install a version of Ruby or two and then switch between them, running ruby &#8212;version to confirm that rbenv is working as it should:<br />
<pre>rbenv global 1.9.3-dev</pre><br />
In this example, we&#8217;re changing the global version of Ruby. Note that rbenv also allows you to change the local version &#8211; by &#8216;local&#8217;, we mean specific to any particular application located in the folder where we execute the command. The &#8216;local&#8217; version will override the &#8216;global&#8217; version.<br />
<h3>Gems</h3><br />
So, now that you&#8217;ve got your Ruby environment squared away, back to those Gems. The easiest way to evaluate your RubyGems installation is to type:<br />
<pre>gem env</pre><br />
This will tell you which version of RubyGems you&#8217;re running, and which versions of Ruby that RubyGems is using to run. Fun fact: to find out which Gems you have installed (useful if you have a botched install like I did and want to confirm what Gems survived and which did not), you can run<br />
<pre>gem server</pre><br />
and then visit http://localhost:8808. You&#8217;ll see a listing of all your Gems with convenient links back to their home pages, etc.</p>
