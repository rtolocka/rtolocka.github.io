		    <p>Not many new blogs lately, mostly because I&#8217;ve been occupied moving this blog to Jekyll (ironically). This has been a good opportunity to muck around with Liquid, yet another templating language. It hasn&#8217;t been unpleasant, although Jekyll has a single-mindedness that can be a bit interesting.</p>

		    <p>Recently I had an issue where a Gem wouldn&#8217;t install properly. As it turned out, I was using the wrong <em>type</em> of ruby (more specifically I was using plain ruby instead of ruby-dev, which is a whole other blog post for another day). This ended up being a great opportunity for a blog post on &#8216;mastering your ruby environment.&#8217; Like many of my posts, this one is oriented towards basic knowledge that beginners can use.</p>

		    <p>Ruby blocks can easily be misunderstood as purely a control flow mechanism &#8211; particularly by Java developers who see the &#8220;do&#8221; and &#8220;yield&#8221; keywords and jump to a logical, if incorrect, conclusion.<br />

<p>Many many blog posts have dealt with this subject, and there are about 100 ways to attack this problem. This one is mine; I don&#8217;t claim it to be perfect; instead I&#8217;ll use it to highlight a few Rails features as we progress.</p>

		    <p>As a long time Java programmer who has made the switch to Ruby, I&#8217;ve honed in a few things that once understood, help make Ruby a lot more readable and fun for those coming from similar backgrounds. I&#8217;ll tackle these below in this post.</p>

		    <p>Ok, dumb title. The point of this blog post (first of two) is to cover a few of what I think are the most important and basic Ruby-isms for a reforming Java developer to learn. The quicker you learn these, the fast you&#8217;ll be off and reading Ruby. This post covers the easy stuff; the next will cover symbols, hash options, and the each statement.</p>

		<p>19 March 2013 <br>
		
		    <p>Partials are an intriguing part of Rails for me. I&#8217;ve had mixed results with dynamic inclusion going back to the days &lt;jsp:include&gt;. It was possible to get some fair-to-middling code re-use going, but exceptional cases and the extra wiring required made it difficult to maintain in practice. Rails use of convention allows you to avoid explicit wiring together of Views and Partials and allow for some huge time saving conveniences. <br />

		    <p>In general, using the Rails asset pipeline to include javascript with your application is preferable to other options. Yet the Rails asset pipeline has some quirks to it (&#8216;magic!&#8217;) that can frustrate newbies trying to understand this Rails feature. I&#8217;ve summarized some of the basic principles surrounding the Rails asset pipeline below, as well as a few of the quirks that can confound effective usage of the pipeline by Rails beginners.<br />
